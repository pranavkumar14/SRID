### Summer Internship at Samsung R&D, Delhi
These are some of the programs I did in my internship at Samsung R&D, Delhi (summer 2022).  
Mainly in the internship I learned about MQTT.   
MQTT is a light weight messaging protocol used mainly for IoT devices.  
Some of programs I made were   
* To publish and subscribe  
* Read a csv file send it using MQTT.  
* Device Discovery : In this before sending and while sending first data we checked the avaibilty of the receiver.
